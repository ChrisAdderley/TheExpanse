=====================
LEVIATHAN WAKES 0.1.0
=====================

This is a small mod that adds some parts based on the Rocinante from The Expanse, a scifi TV show. These parts could be considered overpowered (ok, yeah they are)

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- None

Optional:
- Community Tech Tree (v3.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Leviathan Wakes before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place engines in various high tech nodes.




============
KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
