    #LOC_LeviathanWakes_frigate-epstein_description = Modern, powerful fusion drive with advanced Epstein containment making use of esoteric physics to stop the ship from combusting from the intense waste heat of the inertially confined fusion reaction. Must be paired with a powerful fusion reactor to function.

    #LOC_LeviathanWakes_frigate-reactor_description = A well-oiled piece of advanced MCRN technology that repeatedly compresses pellets of lithium fuel to absurd densities, creating energized fusion plasma that supplies power to the ship's drive and can be tapped to run ship systems.
